title: Learning cost function for real time adaptive motion planning
date: 2019-01-01 13:32:20 +0300
description: Real time Path Planning algorithms find the optimal path by choosing trajectories with minimum cost. In majority of these cases, energy, time, Euclidean distance of the robot from the goal position are constituted in the Cost function. This works aims at developing a generalised approach to find the cost function using Deep Learning.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
