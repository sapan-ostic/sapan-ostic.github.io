Following were homeworks for my CS-525 Reinforcement Learning Course at WPI.
### Playing Atari Games using DQN:
The model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning, whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function estimating future rewards.

### Go-To-Goal Grid world problem using Q Learning
Given a static map of START, GOAL and location of obstacles, the agent learns the best path to the goal from any initial position.
