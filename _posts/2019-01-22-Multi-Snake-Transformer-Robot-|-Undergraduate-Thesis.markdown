Operations in search and rescue requires self-reconfigurable robotics systems to overcome unforeseen locomotion hindrances. An individual robotic system excellent in accomplishing a specific task fails to overcome operations. This work aims developing a modular self-reconfigurable robotic system which extends the traversing versatility of snake robots to legged locomotion. Each snake robot form a basic building block of the modular system. Simulation results verify the capability of the design to transform and execute legged locomotion. The robotic system can easily rearrange to various linear, bipedal and quadrupedal morphologies through magnetic connections.
