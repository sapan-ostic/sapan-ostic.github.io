Robots   have   long   been   used   in   the   operationtheaters  primarily  for  a  wide  variety  of  applications  rangingfrom  neurosurgery  to  laparoscopic  surgery.  This  demands  aregulated force control between the manipulator and the tissuesin  which  the  robot  interacts.  Although  the  da  Vinci  SurgicalRobot  has  risen  as  a  pioneering  tool  in  the  field  of  minimallyinvasive  surgery,  the  platform  lacks  a  controller  that  governsthe  interaction  of  the  robotâ€™s  end  effector  with  its  surroundingenvironment  in  a  compliant  manner.  This  work  presents  thedynamics  modeling  and  design  of  an  impedance  controller  forthe  Master  Tool  Manipulator  of  the  da  Vinci  robot  in  a  sim-ulated  environment.
