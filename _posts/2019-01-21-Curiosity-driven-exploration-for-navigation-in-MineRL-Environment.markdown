Rewards  from  the  environment  depict  how  well  the agent is performing in the required task. Majority of the  techniques  in  reinforcement  learning  depend  upon the  reward  from  the  environment  to  select  the  actions which  maximize  the  overall  reward.  However,  in  real-world scenario such explicit rewards might be sparse or even not available to the agent. The idea of Curiosity-Driven learning, is to build a reward function that is intrinsic to the agent (generated by the agent itself). In this work, we compare two Curiosity-driven learning methods for navigation task in MineRL Environment.
