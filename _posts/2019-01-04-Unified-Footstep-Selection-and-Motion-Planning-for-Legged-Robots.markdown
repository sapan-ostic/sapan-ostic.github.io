Developed an iterative optimization method that plans in real-time over a receding horizon to address the problem of dynamic footstep planning for legged robot. We provided analytical solution to linearization of event-based discrete hybrid dynamics, allowing superior accuracy with lower computation and time complexity compared to numerical differentiation. Besides this, we established new method to incorporate terrain as soft-state constraint into the iLQR formulation.
