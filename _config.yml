  I am a Robotics Graduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
  My research focuses on developing real-time motion planning and controls algorithms for robot navigation in dynamically-changing environments.
  I am also excited in exploiting tools from Deep Learning to enable what's beyond the conventional methods.

about-author: I am a Robotics Graduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Currently, I am working with Prof. Jing Xiao at Adaptive and Intelligent Robotics (AIR) Lab, WPI. My research focuses on developing real-time motion planning and controls algorithms for robot navigation in dynamically-changing environments. I am also excited in exploiting tools from Deep Learning to enable what's beyond the conventional methods. Last year, I worked with Dr. Matthew Travers as a Visiting Scholar at Robotics Institute, CMU on motion planning and controls for legged robots.
